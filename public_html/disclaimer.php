With each and every contribution and donation, more and more games are becoming closer and closer to either booting or full playability.<br>

							 When dumping video game software, users are subject to country-specific software distribution laws. RPCS3 is not designed to enable illegal activity. We do not promote piracy nor do we allow it under any circumstances. Any users conversing about piracy upon joining the Discord server, forums or GitHub community will receive administrative action.
