								<h2>The Project</h2>
							</div>
							<div class='container-tx2-block darkmode-txt'>
								<p>
									 RPCS3 is a multi-platform open-source Sony PlayStation 3 emulator and debugger written in C++ for Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD. The purpose of the project is to completely and accurately emulate the Sony PlayStation 3 Computer Entertainment System in its entirety with the power of open-source community and reverse engineering. <br>
									<br>
									 Our goal is to preserve the legacy of the PlayStation 3 hardware and its vast library by bringing it and its exclusives to the PC platform. We want to achieve this by targeting and supporting multiple operating systems as well as being compatible with a wide range of computer hardware with realistic requirements.

								<h2>The History (2011 — Present)</h2>
							</div>
							<div class='container-tx2-block darkmode-txt'>
								<p>
									 The project was founded by programmers DH and Hykem in May of 2011. RPCS3 was first hosted on Google Code and was eventually migrated to GitHub later on in its development. The emulator's first successful game boot were primarily composed of smaller homebrew projects and focused hardware tests. <br>
									<br>
									 The emulator was later publicly released in June of 2012 and gained substantial attention from both the open-source community and PlayStation enthusiasts alike. Today, RPCS3 is co-developed by two new developers, Nekotekina and kd-11 in tandem with an amazing team of GitHub contributors.

								<h2>The People</h2>
							</div>
							<div class='container-tx2-block darkmode-txt'>
								<p>
									 The project is currently maintained and organized by a unique cast of characters, all with meaningful roles to contribute to different aspects of the project. Whether it's working on the emulator directly, coordinating community efforts or even keeping this very website current, everyone plays a role that adds to the bigger picture. <br>
									<br>
									 Internal team members aren't the only contributors. A lot of the progress made in making PlayStation 3 emulation possible on PC is thanks to the many developers we've received contributions from in our GitHub community. While many developers do come and go, we do welcome anyone and everyone who is interested in improving the codebase.
